# course-v3
The 3rd edition of [course.fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai). See the `nbs` folder for the notebooks.
Using the fastai wrapper for PyTorch, I built a simple classifier for different types of athletes. It differentiates between Bodybuilders, Footballers, and Volleyball Players.
It uses a pre-trained ResNet model which got fine-tuned with several pictures of given classes from Google.
